# Misc. History Quiz

## **Description**

This is a short history quiz on miscellaneous topics. When the participant gets a question wrong, the program will give you hints and let you attempt the question again.
Rethinking a problem and being guided toward an answer is often a better way of learning than being passively told the right way to do something.
